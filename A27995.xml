            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>To the Right Honourable WILLIAM, Earl of <hi>BEDFORD,</hi> Knight of the moſt Noble Order of the GARTER, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> My very good Lord, and Patron.</head>
            <opener>
               <salute>My Lord,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>THough I have not purſued the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign, which I have long had in my thoughts, of making ſome publick acknowledgment of my obligations to your Lordſhip, for placing me, when I thought not of it, in this Station which I hold in <hi>Covent-Garden:</hi> yet I have onely deferred it, till the moſt proper opportunity, as it ſeems to me, for this ſmall expreſſion of my gratitude. For I could not have prefixed your Lordſhips Name to any Work of mine, which I
<pb facs="tcp:106870:3"/>believe would have been ſo acceptable, as this wherewith I now preſent you; de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiring it may remain as a laſting Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of the ſenſe I have of the favours I have received from your Lordſhip. Whom as I have always obſerved to have a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Veneration and Affection for the holy Scriptures, ſo I know to be a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Reader of them: And therefore humbly offer this aſſiſtance to your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip for the underſtanding of the oldeſt Book (as I have ſhown) of that Sacred Volumn, which, I am confident, you eſteem above all earthly Treaſures.</p>
            <p>There have been many large Volumns written for its Explication; which will coſt abundance of time and pains to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uſe; and after all, the deſign and ſcope of the Whole may not be underſtood, while the Readers mind ſtays ſo long, in the ſeveral Parts. I have therefore taken quite another courſe, and only given the ſenſe of it in a compendious, but perſpicuous, <hi>Paraphraſe</hi> (or <hi>Meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phraſe</hi> rather, as the Ancients would
<pb facs="tcp:106870:3"/>have called it) which is not much longer than the Text, put into other words. It would have been more eaſie to have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larged it, than it was to make it thus ſhort: which I the rather choſe to do, not meerly becauſe it will be more uſefull for thoſe who have little leaſure, or leſs money; but becauſe thereby I have pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, I perſwade my ſelf, the Majeſty of the Book; and made it ſtill look not like the Word of a man, but, as it is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, the Word of God.</p>
            <p>Which I could never have preſented to your Lordſhip and the World, more ſeaſonably than now; when the State of our affairs is ſo dangerouſly perplexed, that we cannot ſtand upright, nor pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve our ſouls from ſinking into the ſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt fears, or diſcontents, or ſome ſuch troubleſom paſſion, without a ſtrong con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence in the moſt Wiſe, Juſt, and Merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Providence of the Almighty: which Orders things, in unſearchable ways, to the good of thoſe that ſtedfaſtly adhere unto him in faithfull Obedience. Which
<pb facs="tcp:106870:4"/>is ſo admirably repreſented in this holy Book, that one cannot read it ſeriouſly, and not be moved to reſign the conduct of our ſelves and all that concerns us unto God's moſt bleſſed will and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure; to wait patiently for him, as the Pſalmiſt ſpeaks, and keep his way; not to be disheartned by any trouble that befalls us, much leſs forſake our integrity: but ſtill expect <hi>the End of the Lord,</hi> as S. <hi>James</hi> ſpeaks, <hi>i. e.</hi> the iſſue to which he will bring our troubles; perſwading our ſelves that he is <hi>very pitifull, and of tender Mercy.</hi> And therefore, as He doth not love to grieve us by laying afflic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions on us; ſo is wont many times to bring the greateſt good out of the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt evil: and to produce it by ſuch un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expected means, as ſhall ſurpriſe us with the greater admiration of his Wiſedom and Goodneſs.</p>
            <p>For a great Reader of Ancient Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters tells us, <q>he hath obſerved in the Hiſtories of all Ages, that the great e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents which determine the fate of great
<pb facs="tcp:106870:4"/>Affairs, do happen leſs frequently ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to deſign, than by accident and occaſion. Our enterprizes here below are derived from above; and we but Engins and Actors of pieces that are compoſed in heaven. <hi>Homo hiſtrio, Deus verò Poeta eſt.</hi> God is the Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign Poet, and we cannot refuſe the part which he appoints us to bear in the Scene. All our buſineſs is to act it well; chearfully complying with his Orders concerning us, and ſubmitting our ſelves to the direction of his Providence.</q>
            </p>
            <p>To which, and all other Religious courſes, did we more heartily apply our ſelves, there is no doubt but that in this Book we might read God's gracious in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions towards this Church and King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom. Which his moſt mercifull Providence would bring, as he did his Servant <hi>Job,</hi> through all theſe clouds which now in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compaſs us, into a ſplendor incomparably beyond all that, wherein hitherto we have appeared. Why ſhould we deſpair of it, when he ſhews by the unexpected diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
<pb facs="tcp:106870:5"/>which he hath made, of the deſigns of our Enemies againſt us, that he hath no mind to caſt us off; if we will not careleſly caſt away our ſelves, by the continued neglect of our duty to him?</p>
            <p>God of his infinite goodneſs, awaken all our hearts to make ſuch a good uſe both of that deliverance, and of our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent diſtreſs (which is ſo great, that we ſee no way out of it, but by his power alone to whom <hi>Job</hi> owed his reſurrection) that we may, in the iſſue, be the more happy and the better eſtabliſhed, for having been ſo miſerably unſetled. In which pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, I am ſure your Lordſhip will cordial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly joyn with,</p>

            <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
            <p>THE ſtudy of the Holy Scriptures is ſo much recommended to us by the Scriptures themſelves, and hath been judged ſo ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary by the holy Doctours of the Church, that S. <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> (who was wont to preſs this duty with great ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtneſs, not only in his Sermons, but in his private diſcourſes with his people) adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures to ſay,<note n="*" place="margin">Hom. <hi>3.</hi> in Lazar. Tom. <hi>V. 243.</hi>
               </note> that <hi>a man cannot, he cannot be ſaved, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs he be converſant in this ſpiritual reading.</hi> But as the neglect of them is very dangerous, when men are able to read them; ſo the reading them without un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, muſt needs be unprofitable. Though a Chriſtian (as the forenamed great Perſon ſpeaks) can no more be without the Scriptures than an Artificer without his tools; yet we muſt acknowledge that he will make but ill work with them in many
<pb facs="tcp:106870:6"/>places, unleſs he be inſtructed how to uſe and apply them to the purpoſe for which they were deſigned. Whoſoever therefore ſhall aſſiſt the minds of Chriſtians by giving a clear meaning of them (in which that holy Father imployed much of his time) it is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain doth great ſervice to God, and to their Souls. For this contributes much to the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of the Holy Scriptures (which want nothing to make them reverenced by conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering men, but to be underſtood) and it invites men to the reading them, and it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyes the heaveniy truth eaſily and delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully into their minds.</p>
            <p>Which hath moved me to attempt the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaining of the moſt ancient Book in the whole Bible, by way of a ſhort Paraphraſe. In which if I have not always tyed my ſelf to our Engliſh Tranſlation (which ever gives an excellent ſence of the Original words) it was becauſe I thought another meaning ſometimes more agreeable to the whole diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe: which I have endeavoured to carry on coherently from firſt to laſt. But if the matter would bear it, I have, when I met with a word of two ſenſes, expreſſed them both. And where I found any difficulty I conſulted with ſuch Interpreters as are of beſt note in the Church: being unwilling to do any thing without the warrant of ſome or other of them. I was forced indeed here and there to follow only my own judgement;
<pb facs="tcp:106870:6"/>but not without the appearance of very ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent reaſons: of which if I ſhould give an account, by adding notes to thoſe places, it would make this, which I intend for com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon uſe, ſwell into too big a Volumn. I have only therefore (in the Argument pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſixed to each Chapter) pointed to ſuch Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtories in the Bible as may help to illuſtrate ſome paſſages: and ſhewn how the diſpute is menaged, till God himſelf determine it.</p>
            <p>But there are two things, of which I think my ſelf bound to give a larger accompt; to avoid the imputation of ſuch novelty, as may be juſtly cenſured. The <hi>One</hi> is, That I have interpreted thoſe three known verſes in the XIX. Chapter, 25, 26, 27. not of <hi>Job</hi>'s re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection from the dead at the laſt day, but of his reſtauration to an happy eſtate in this world; after he had been ſo ſorely afflicted. There are many, of no mean eſteem, (Mr. <hi>Calvin</hi> amongſt the reſt) who have done ſo before me; in following whom, I do not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake the ſenſe of the ancient Doctours. For though I take that to be the literal ſenſe of the words, yet I doubt not there is another more ſecret and hidden, which lies covered under them; and that we ought to look upon <hi>Job</hi>'s Reſtauration (and ſo I have always explained it) as a notable type of the future Reſurrection of our Bodies out of the Grave. And accordingly our Church hath very fitly applied the words (as many of the Fathers
<pb facs="tcp:106870:7"/>do) to this purpoſe; in the Office of the Burial of the Dead.</p>
            <p>St. <hi>Hierome</hi> (or the Author of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentaries upon <hi>Job</hi> under his name) is my Guide in this buſineſs: who ſaith no more then this, that <hi>Job</hi> in theſe words, <hi>reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onem futuram prophetat in Spiritu,</hi> prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cieth in the Spirit the future Reſurrection. Now the words of the Prophets had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly an immediate reſpect to ſome thing which was then doing or ſhortly to be done, beſides that ſenſe which the Holy-Ghoſt di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected them to ſignify in the latter dayes. And ſo had theſe words of <hi>Job;</hi> of which that Father indeed gives us only the My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtical ſenſe, but he doth ſo in many other places of that Book, where it is certain and acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged, the holy man had another meaning, in which he was more nearly concerned. I ſhall refer the Reader only to one place in the <hi>Firſt</hi> Chapter: where he ſaith that <hi>Job</hi> did <hi>ferre typum Chriſti</hi>
               <note n="*" place="margin">And ſo he ſaith in his Praeface, <hi>Figuram Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſti portavit.</hi> And in his Concluſion <hi>XLII. 14. Figuram mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtè habuit Salvato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris.</hi>

<pb facs="tcp:106870:7"/>ſenſe, when it is certain another (upon which that is built) is firſt intended. And ſo we are to take his expoſition upon theſe words, which <hi>ſecundum myſticos intellectus</hi> (as he ſpeaks, XXXVIII. 16.) <hi>according to the hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den interpretations</hi> are to be underſtood of the Reſurrection of the dead at the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond coming of Chriſt: but relate in the firſt place to <hi>Job</hi>'s reſurrection out of that miſerable condition wherein he lay, which was a figure of the other. <q>They therefore who interpret theſe words otherways (to ſpeak with that Father in his Commenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries upon <hi>Ezek.</hi> XXXVII. 1. <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) ought not to make me ill thought of, as if by expounding them in the literal ſenſe only, I took away a proof of the Reſurrection from the dead. For I know there are far ſtronger teſtimonies (of which there can be no doubt nor diſpute) to be found for the confirmation of that truth. On thoſe let us rely, on the plain words of Him who is the Truth (and of whom <hi>Job</hi> was but a Figure) which are abundantly ſufficient to ſupport our faith: and let none imagine, that we <hi>Give occaſion to Hereticks</hi>
               </q> (as he ſpeaks preſently after) <q>
                  <hi>if we deny theſe words to be meant of the general Reſurrection.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Second</hi> thing of which I am to give an account is, that I have not expounded <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemoth</hi> to ſignify the <hi>Elephant,</hi> nor <hi>Levia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than</hi> to ſignify the <hi>Whale:</hi> becauſe many of
<pb facs="tcp:106870:8"/>their Characters do not agree to them; but every one of them to the deſcription which the writers of Natural Hiſtory have given of two other Creatures. And therefore I have herein followed the guidance of that excellent Critick <hi>Bochartus,</hi> who takes the former for the <hi>River-horſe,</hi> and the later for the <hi>Crocodile:</hi> as I have expreſſed it in the Margin, but put neither of them in the Text. For I leave every one, as our Tranſlatours have done, to apply the words to any other Creatures, if they can find any beſides thoſe now mentioned, which have all the qualities that are here aſcribed to them.</p>
            <p>I have adventured alſo in the beginning to add a few words, as the manner of Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phraſts is, to give an account of the time when <hi>Job</hi> lived, which ſeemes to have been before the <hi>Children of Iſrael</hi> came out of <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt.</hi> For though there be plain mention, of the drowning of the <hi>Old World,</hi> and the bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of <hi>Sodom,</hi> in this Book, yet there is no alluſion to the drowning of <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther miraculous works which attended their deliverance. Nor is there any notice taken of that Revelation of Gods will to <hi>Moſes,</hi> when <hi>Elihu</hi> reckons up thoſe ways whereby God was wont to diſcover himſelf to men.

            <p>And therefore one Uſe we may make of this Book is, to inform our ſelves what are the true natural dictates of humane reaſon; which teaches greater Chaſtity than many Chriſtians are now willing to obſerve; ſtrict Juſtice, both private and publick; compaſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onate Charity to thoſe who are in need; together with a pious care to pleaſe God, and to worſhip and confide in him alone: as we may learn here better than from any other Book in the World. For in the XXXI. Chapter, <hi>Job</hi> gives ſuch a character of his Life, with reſpect to all theſe, as declares both that there is a Law written in our hearts, and what inſtructions it gives us, if we will attend to it. There is not the leaſt ſyllable that we read concerning his being Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed, or obſerving the Sabbath, or ſuch like parts of the Moſaical Diſcipline, which aſſures us he was neither a natural <hi>Iſraelite,</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:106870:9"/>nor a <hi>Proſelyte</hi> (as St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> ſpeaks<note n="*" place="margin">Lib. <hi>XVIII.</hi> Cap. <hi>47.</hi> De Civit. Dei.</note>) and yet he found ſuch a rule of life in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, that, by the aſſiſtance of the Divine Grace, he ordered not only his outward actions, but the inward motions of his mind after ſuch a manner, as is <hi>not unſuitable to the Evangelical Doctrine of our Saviour.</hi> They are the words of <hi>Euſebius</hi> in the place fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>named; where he doth not fear to add, that <hi>the Word of Chriſt hath publiſhed to all Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons that moſt ancient manner of Godlineſs which was among the firſt Fathers: ſo that the</hi> New-Covenant <hi>is no other than that old godly polity, which was before the times of</hi> Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes.

            <p>The Hebrew Books indeed are full of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes concerning certain Precepts, which all mankind after the Flood obſerved, but cannot all of them be deduced from the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of Reaſon. They call them the VII. <hi>Precepts</hi> of the ſons of <hi>Noah:</hi> who delivered them, they ſay, to all his Children by whom the World was peopled; and therefore the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> ever exacted the obſervance of them from all thoſe <hi>Gentiles,</hi> whom they admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted as Proſelytes at large to their Religion.
<pb facs="tcp:106870:9"/>
               <hi>Two</hi> of thoſe Precepts concerned their duty toward the bleſſed Creator: the next <hi>Four</hi> reſpected their duty towards their Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours: the <hi>Laſt</hi> forbad cruelty towards other Creatures. They are reckoned up commonly in this order. I. Concerning <hi>Strange Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip,</hi> or Idolatry. II. About <hi>blaſpheming the Name of God.</hi> III. About <hi>Murder.</hi> IV. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the <hi>uncovering of Nakedneſs,</hi> or all ſil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy Mixtures. V. About <hi>Theft and Rapine.</hi> VI. About <hi>Judicatures</hi> and Civil Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; to make the other Precepts more care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully obſerved. VII. About <hi>not eating of any fleſh which is cut off from any Animal alive.</hi> The Authours that treat of theſe are innumerable; among whom I ſhall only mention <hi>Maimonides;</hi> who thus delivers his opinion of them in his Treatiſe of <hi>Kings,</hi> Chap. IX.</p>
            <p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Adam</hi> the firſt man received commands about <hi>Six</hi> things (which are thoſe firſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove mentioned) from whence it is, that the Mind of Man inclines more pronely to them, than to the reſt of the Commands which we have received from our Maſter <hi>Moſes.</hi> Beſides theſe, it is manifeſt, <hi>Noah</hi> received another, according to what we read IX. Gen. 4. <hi>Fleſh with the life thereof you ſhall not eat.</hi> And thus things ſtood throughout the whole world until the dayes of <hi>Abraham;</hi> to whom there was ſuperadded the Precept of Circumciſion.</q>
            </p>
            <pb facs="tcp:106870:10"/>
            <p>But as there is not the leaſt ſigne that Circumciſion was part of <hi>Job</hi>'s Religion, ſo there is no footſtep at all remaining of his obſervance of the laſt of thoſe VII. Precepts, which they ſay all the Sons of <hi>Noah,</hi> who were pious, carefully obeyed. A Great man of our own Nation<note n="*" place="margin">Mr. <hi>Selden</hi> L. ult. de Jure Naturali, &amp;c. Cap. <hi>II.</hi>
               </note>hath ſifted this buſineſs with as much diligence as is poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible; but after all his ſearch, he is fain to ſtop at thoſe firſt <hi>Six</hi> Precepts delivered to <hi>Adam.</hi> For though this Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Character be given of <hi>Job</hi> in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the Book that he was a perfect, or ſimple, and upright man, fearing God and eſchewing evil; and in the XXXI. Chapter, and other places, there are particular in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances given of his abhorring <hi>ſtrange Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip,</hi> (v. 26.) <hi>Blaſphemy,</hi> (Chap. I. 5.) <hi>Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,</hi> (XXXI. 29, 31.) <hi>Adultery,</hi> and other filthineſs, (<hi>Ib.</hi> v. 1, 9.) <hi>Theft,</hi> Rapine and Deceit, (v. 5, 6, 7.) for the puniſhment of which he mentions <hi>Judges</hi> in his days, (v. 11, 28.) and was himſelf one of the chief: (XXIX. 11.) Yet there is not ſo much as one word to be found, that I can diſcern, concerning the <hi>Seventh</hi> Precept; whether we underſtand thereby eating fleſh with the blood in it; or, which is more likely (becauſe other Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons that were not Jews, might lawfully eat that which dyed of it ſelf, XIV. <hi>Deut.</hi> 21.) eating that which was cut alive from any li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Creature.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:106870:10"/>
            <p>Which makes me think that it was not ſo generally known, as the Jews now pretend; till the memory of it was revived by <hi>Moſes,</hi> among whoſe Anceſtours the Tradition was more carefully preſerved, than in other Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. For <hi>Job,</hi> and ſuch like pious perſons, ſeem to have been governed by thoſe Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts only which the firſt Man received; that is, the dictates of Natural reaſon. Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to thoſe words of <hi>Tertullian</hi> in his Book againſt the Jews: <note place="margin">Chap. <hi>2.</hi>
               </note> where he contends that <hi>before the Law of</hi> Moſes <hi>written in Tables of Stone, there was a Law not written, which was naturally underſtood, and obſerved by the Fathers:</hi> Which he elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where calls the <hi>Common Law, which we meet withal in</hi> publico Mundi, <hi>in the ſtreets and high-ways of the world, in the natural Tables:</hi> which mankind having broken, our Saviour came to repair and renew; abrogating the Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> in which the Jews had pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced too much confidence, while they neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected theſe natural Precepts. Or rather He hath not only ingaged us by his holy Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to obſerve thoſe more ſtrictly, but raiſed them alſo to a greater height of purity; according to that of St. <hi>Chryſoſtome,</hi> in his Book of Virginity: <hi>We are to ſhew greater Vertue, becauſe now there is an abundant Grace poured out; and great is the gift of the coming of Chriſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But the principal benefit (to omit the naming
<pb facs="tcp:106870:11"/>of many other, whereby I might recommend this work) which I hope pious Souls, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially the <hi>Afflicted,</hi> will reap by this Book, is to be perſwaded thereby that all things are ordered and diſpoſed by Almighty God; without whoſe command or permiſſion nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther good Angels, nor the Devil, nor Men, nor any other Creature, can do any thing. And that as his Power is infinite, ſo is his Wiſedom and Goodneſs; which is able to bring good out of evil. And therefore we ought not to complain of Him in any condition, as if He neglected us or dealt hardly with us; but rather chearfully ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit our ſelves to his bleſſed will; which ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver doth any thing without reaſon, though we cannot always comprehend it. To that iſſue God himſelf at laſt brings all the diſpute between <hi>Job</hi> and his friends: repreſenting his Works throughout the World to be ſo wonderful and unaccountable, that it is fit for us to acknowledge our ignorance, but never accuſe his Providence; if we cannot ſee the cauſe why he ſends any affliction or continues it long upon us. Inſtead of murmuring and complaining, in ſuch a caſe, this Book effec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually teaches us to reſigne our ſelves abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely to Him; ſilently to adore and reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence the unſearchable depth of his wiſe counſels; contentedly to bear what He in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicts upon us; ſtill to aſſert his righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, in the midſt of the calamities which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fall
<pb facs="tcp:106870:11"/>the good, and in the moſt proſperous ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſes of the wicked; and ſtedfaſtly to believe that all at laſt ſhall turn to our advantage, if like His ſervant <hi>Job,</hi> we perſevere in faith, and hope, and patience.</p>
            <p>To which this Book gives ſo high an incou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement, and contains ſuch powerful com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts for the Afflicted; that the old Tradition is, <hi>Moſes</hi> could not find any thing like it for the ſupport and ſatisfaction of the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> in their Egyptian bondage: and therefore took the pains to tranſlate it into their Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, out of the <hi>Syriack</hi> wherein it was firſt written. Thus He who writes the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentaries upon this Book under the name of <hi>Origen,</hi> tells us <q>That he found <hi>in Antiquo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum dictis</hi> in the ſayings of the Ancients; that when the Great <hi>Moſes</hi> was ſent by God into <hi>Egypt,</hi> and beheld the afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> to be ſo grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous, that nothing he could ſay was able to comfort them in that lamentable condition; He declared to them the terrible ſufferings of <hi>Job,</hi> with his happy deliverance; and ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting them down in writing alſo, gave this Book to that diſtreſſed people. That read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing theſe things in their ſeveral Tribes and Families, and hearing how ſorely this bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed man ſuffered; they might comfort and exhort one another, to endure with pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence and thankſgiving the evils which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compaſſed them: and hearing withall how
<pb facs="tcp:106870:12"/>bountifully God rewarded <hi>Job</hi> for his pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience, they might hope for deliverance; and expect the benefit of a bleſſed reward of their Labours.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>Be ye conſtant, O Children of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> (ſaid <hi>Moſes,</hi> with a pleaſing countenance, when he delivered this Book into their hands) do not faint in your minds, O ye poſterity of <hi>Abraham,</hi> but ſuffer grief and bear theſe evils patiently, as that man in the Land of <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>z</hi> did, whoſe name was <hi>Job:</hi> who though he was a righteous and faithful perſon, in whom was no fault, yet ſuffered the ſoreſt torments by the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice of the Devil; as you do now moſt unjuſtly from <hi>Pharaoh</hi> and the Egyptians. They treat you indeed very baſely, and have enſlaved you, without any fault of yours, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But do not deſpair of a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter condition; you ſhall be delivered as <hi>Job</hi> was, and have a reward of your tribula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, like that which God gave to him.</q>
            </p>
            <p>There follows a great deal more to the ſame purpoſe in that Writer, which I ſhall not tranſcribe. But only add that the Church of Chriſt, as he obſerves, was wont, after this example, to read this Paſſion of <hi>Job</hi> pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly in all their Aſſemblies; upon <hi>Holy-days</hi> (when they commemorated the Martyrs) and upon <hi>Faſting days,</hi> and <hi>days of Abſtinence;</hi> and upon the days of our <hi>Saviour's Paſſion:</hi> of which they thought they ſaw a figure in
<pb facs="tcp:106870:12"/>the ſufferings of <hi>Job;</hi> as of our Saviour's Reſurrection and exaltation, in <hi>Job</hi>'s won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful recovery, and advancement to a greater height of Proſperity. And as they read this Hiſtory in the Church publickly; ſo when they went to viſit any one privately that was in grief, mourning, or ſorrow, they read a Leſſon of the patience of <hi>Job</hi> for their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort and ſupport under their troubles; and to take away the diſtreſs and anguiſh of their heart.</p>
            <p>I pray God it may have that effect upon all afflicted perſons, who ſhall read it; and that others alſo, conſidering the inſtability of all worldly things (which is here alſo lively repreſented) may uſe their proſperity with ſuch moderation, that they may bear a change of their condition, if it come, with an equal mind. I am ſure there is no Man, of whatſoever rank, or in whatſoever con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, he be; but may learn very much, if he pleaſe, from this admirable Pattern. Which is the very firſt that is left us upon record, of a Vertuous Life, both in Proſperity and in adverſity, and that not only as a Private man but as a Prince: <hi>In whom it is the greater commendation to obey the will of God; becauſe he hath more means and temptations to fulfil his own.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That therefore ſhall conclude the character of <hi>Job;</hi> who when he had no ſuperiour to controle him (as you may read, <hi>Chap.</hi> XXIX.
<pb facs="tcp:106870:13"/>and XXXI.) gave ſuch an example of Piety and Devotion, Humility and Moderation, Chaſtity and Purity, Juſtice and Equity, Charity and Compaſſion; as few have done in a private Condition. This is as admirable, and will be praiſed as much to all generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, as his generous Patience. Which was ſo much famed in ancient times, that (from a paſſage, which ſome Editions of the LXX. have added to the Concluſion of this Book) it went as a common Tradition <gap reason="foreign">

Now there dwelt in the neighbouring Provinces three great men, with whom <hi>Job</hi> had long maintained a particular friendſhip; who, hearing the ſad tidings of his Sufferings, came every one from his country to viſit him. Their names were <hi>Eliphaz</hi> the <hi>Temanite, Bildad</hi> the <hi>Shuhite,</hi> and <hi>Zophar</hi> the <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amathite;</hi> who all three met at his houſe on the ſame day, according to an appointment they had made, to come and condole with him, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort him.</p>

And being overcharged with Grief, (without the leaſt word of comfort from his Friends,) he that had for ſome time born the weight of his Afflictions with an admirable Conſtancy, could not contain himſelf any longer, but burſts out (to ſuch a degree was the anguiſh of his ſpirit increaſed) into the moſt paſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate Complaints of the Miſeries of humane Life. The conſideration of which made him prefer Death much before it; and wiſh that, either he had never come into the world, or gone preſently out of it again, or, at leaſt, might now forthwith be diſmiſſed.</p>

                  <p>The purpoſe of this Chapter (in which <hi>Job</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies to <hi>Bildad</hi>) is to ſhew, that it would be ſufficient for him alſo merely to repeat the ſame things, as they had done in Ten Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes: But the more to aggravate their want of Compaſſion, or rather Cruelty, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward him, he repreſents ſeveral new things, which made his condition more deplorable then he had hitherto ſaid. One of which was, that he could not tell the Reaſon why God dealt thus with him: who notwithſtanding was ſo gracious, that in the depth of this Miſery and Anguiſh, He affords him a glim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mering of a comfortable Hope, (which began now to appear in his Soul, and which he had hitherto wanted,) that God would at laſt take pity upon him, and ſhew his Friends their errour, by reſtoring him to his former Health and Splendour. That ſeems to be the literal meaning of the <hi>25.</hi> and <hi>26.</hi> ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, and of the two next that follow: where, among other things, he ſays he doubted not but his Redeemer ſhould <hi>ſtand laſt upon the earth,</hi> (ſo it is in the Hebrew, the word <hi>day</hi> not being there,) that is, quite overcome the Devil, and deliver him from theſe Diſtreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes; like a mighty Conquerour, who keeps
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:106870:66"/>the field, when all his oppoſers are routed and fled away. But in this he was, as S. <hi>Auſtin</hi> calls him, <hi>eximius Prophetarum,</hi> and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſied of the Reſurrection of the Body at the laſt day.</p>

Which he illuſtrates indeed after an excellent faſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, with great variety of Figures, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marks upon Hiſtories as old as the World. In ſome of which he had obſerved, that the Wicked after their Fall had made not able at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts to get up again; but by the hand of God were ſo cruſhed, that they could never riſe more. All the ſlaw in his Diſcourſe is this, (which was common to him with the reſt,) that he imagined God never varied from this method; and therefore <hi>Job,</hi> without doubt, was a very bad man, though
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:106870:70"/>it did not appear he was, any other way, but by his Infelicity.</p>

Whoſe ſilence ſo raiſed the ſpirit of <hi>Job,</hi> that he now triumphs over his Opponents: as the word MASCHAL, which we render PARABLE, may denote.

Such is the following Diſcourſe of <hi>Job,</hi> which begins (in this Chapter) with a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hement Proteſtation, that he would never deſert his Plea; nor yield to their Doctrine, that a remarkable Vengeance always attends
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:106870:93"/>upon Wickedneſs in this world: though he grants, and largely here aſſerts, that ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times there doth.</p>

                  <p>It appears, by the <hi>15.</hi> verſe of this Chapter, that there were ſeveral other perſons preſent, beſides thoſe that are named, when this Diſpute was held between <hi>Job</hi> and his three Friends. Among whom there was a young man named <hi>Elihu;</hi> who was either a <hi>Syrian,</hi> (in which language this Book was firſt writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, and tranſlated by <hi>Moſes</hi> into <hi>Hebrew,</hi> ſays the Authour of the Commentaries under <hi>Origen</hi>'s name,) deſcended from the ſecond Son of <hi>Nahor, Abraham</hi>'s Brother, XXII. <hi>Gen. 21.</hi> or an <hi>Idumaean,</hi> of the ſame Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try with <hi>Eliphaz</hi> the <hi>Temanite,</hi> XXV. <hi>Jer. 23.</hi> I have made him a <hi>Syrian</hi> in my Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phraſe, becauſe he is ſaid to be of the kindred of <hi>Ram:</hi> by whom we are to underſtand ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Aram,</hi> or, as the <hi>Hebrews</hi> think, <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham;</hi> by whom ſuch Wiſedom and Piety might be promoted in his Brother's Family, as is apparent in <hi>Elihu.</hi> Who, though much inferiour to the reſt in years, (for which reaſon he had beld his peace thus long,) yet was much ſuperiour to them in Knowledge. Which he diſcovers in the judicious Cenſures he here paſſes, not onely upon the three Friends, but upon <hi>Job</hi> himſelf: whom he hath nothing to charge withall, relating to
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:106870:113"/>any Crime committed before this Affliction befell him; but thinks he had not managed the Diſpute about it with ſo much Calmneſs and Submiſſion to God as became his Piety. In this he differs from thoſe that ſpake before him: For I do not find that he blames him for any Miſcarriages, but thoſe onely which he obſerved in the heat of his Diſputation; and he ſpends his time, rather in juſtifying God, then in carping at <hi>Job,</hi> as the other had done.</p>

                  <p>Here <hi>Elihu</hi> addreſſes his Speech to <hi>Job</hi> alone, (for he rejected all that the <hi>three</hi> Friends had ſaid, as ſufficiently confuted by <hi>Job</hi> in his Diſpute with them,) and tells him, <hi>firſt,</hi> that he was the man who would now plead with him in God's behalf, (as he had oft de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired,) and that he was no unequal match for him. And <hi>then</hi> begins to reprehend thoſe paſſages which he thought were blameable in <hi>Job</hi>'s Speeches; particularly his inſiſting ſo much upon his Integrity: which, though true, ſhould not have been mentioned with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out due acknowledgment, that the Sovereign of the World had done him no wrong in thus afflicting him; and that it was not fit for him to queſtion the Wiſedom and Juſtice of God's Providence, becauſe he did not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand it. For the care of God over Man and his kindneſs to him, he ſhews, is ſo ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent, upon ſo many ſcores, that it ought not to be denied becauſe of the unaccountable Afflictions that may befall us; which we ought rather to think are one of the ways whereby He doth Man good.</p>

                  <p>Here <hi>Job</hi> ſhews himſelf a far more humble and teachable perſon then his three Friends: for, though <hi>Elihu</hi> had invited him to make what exceptions he pleaſed to his Diſcourſe in the former Chapter, he would not open his mouth; becauſe he plainly ſaw that <hi>Elihu</hi> had hit upon the thing wherein he was defec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive. And ſo this young man proceeds to carry the Charge a little higher, and tells him, with more ſharpneſs then before, that there were ſome words in his Diſcourſes which ſounded in his ears, as if he accuſed God's Juſtice and Goodneſs. For what elſe did he mean when he complained that God did not doe him right; and that he deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed alike both good and bad? Which raſh Aſſertions he overthrows from the conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Sovereign Dominion, Power, Righteouſneſs and Wiſedom of God: and repreſents to him what behaviour and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe would have better become him, then that which he had uſed.</p>

Which, I ſuppoſe, was the reaſon he doth not contradict him, though he continue, here in this Chapter, to faſten the very ſame harſh ſenſe upon his words, v. <hi>2, 3.</hi> Which he refutes from the conſideration of the infinite diſproportion there is between Man and God: who is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the worſe indeed for any Evil, nor at all the better for any Good that we doe: and yet hath ſuch a Love to Mankind, that it is certain He would not have them miſerable, but takes care for their relief when they are oppreſſed, if they addreſs themſelves, as they ought, to Him.</p>

                  <p>What <hi>Elihu</hi> had ſaid concerning the Divine Majeſty, in the <hi>22.</hi> verſe of the foregoing, God declares to be true, by a ſenſible demonſtration, as I have expreſſed it in the firſt Verſe of this Chapter. In which God himſelf appears as a Judge (according to <hi>Job</hi>'s repeated deſires) to decide this great Controverſy. And taking up the Argument begun by <hi>Elihu,</hi> (who came neareſt to the truth,) and proſecuting it in unimitable words, (excelling his and all other mens in the loftineſs of the ſtyle, as much as Thunder doth a Whiſper,) He convinces <hi>Job</hi> of his Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance and Weakneſs; by ſhewing him how little he underſtood of the moſt obvious things in this World. Intending from thence, at laſt, to infer, that he who found himſelf puzzled, when he went about to give an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the meaneſt of God's viſible Works, ſhould not preſume to penetrate into his ſecret Counſels; nor queſtion his Goodneſs, no more then he could his Wiſedom and Power, though he knew not why he was afflicted. One inſtance had been ſufficient to bring <hi>Job</hi> to a Non-plus; but He heaps up abundance, to humble him the more, when he ſaw how much cauſe there was for it: whether he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:106870:136"/>the Earth, or the Heavens; the Sea, or the Sun; things contained in the boſome of the Sea, or in the bowels of the Earth; eſpecially all the Meteors (as we call them) which are formed in the Clouds, and the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtellations in the higher Regions; together with the Beaſts upon the earth, and the Birds which ſly in the air; one of each of which he mentions in the end of this Chapter.</p>

This Repentance God accepts; and for his ſake grants a Pardon alſo to his Friends, whom he condemns as more faulty then <hi>Job.</hi> Who after this receives extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary marks of God's Favour; and hath ſuch an ample Recompence made him for his Loſſes, as may incourage all poſterity to perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere in well doing and patient ſuffering; believing ſtedfaſtly that nothing can be done or permitted by God without much reaſon, (whoſe Wiſedom ſhines ſo gloriouſly in all his Works,) and humbly expecting a comfortable iſſue out of all our Troubles.</p>

            <head>AN APPENDIX TO THE PARAPHRASE.</head>
            <p>HERE ends the Book of <hi>Job:</hi> whoſe ſhort Sufferings (for the ſpace of XII months, as the <hi>Hebrews</hi> reckon in <hi>Seder Olam</hi>) were recompenſed with a very long Life in great Proſperity. If we could rely upon all their Traditions, this might have been added to the Paraphraſe up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the laſt words, that the whole time of his Life was two hundred and ten years. For in the <hi>Hieruſalem Targum</hi> upon XII. <hi>Exod.</hi> 40. and in <hi>Bereſchit Rabba</hi> upon XLII. <hi>Gen.</hi> 2. they make account that the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> ſtaid juſt ſo long in <hi>Egypt:</hi> And in the <hi>Chronicle</hi> fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>named, and in <hi>Bava Bathra</hi> and other Books they tell us, that <hi>Job</hi> was born that very year when <hi>Jacob</hi> went with his Family down thither to ſojourn; and died that year when they were delivered from thence by the hand of <hi>Moſes.</hi> But this agrees neither with what other of their Authours ſay, whom I mentioned in my Preface; nor with the LXX, who in the laſt verſe but one of this Book inſert this
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:106870:157"/>Clauſe, <hi>All the days of his life were two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and forty years.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This indeed might be eaſily reconciled with the account before mentioned, if we did but rectify their numbers in the beginning of that verſe by the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Truth, and cut off the thirty years which they have added to the true time that he lived after his reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very from his ſickneſs: for then this paſſage alſo muſt be corrected, and in ſtead of 240, we muſt ſet down 210. Which we might alſo prove in this manner (out of <hi>Seder Olam,</hi> Cap. 3.) to be the right account of his Age: becauſe it is ſaid v. 10. of the laſt Chapter, that <hi>the Lord added to Job the dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of what he had before;</hi> and therefore if an hundred and forty years were added, he had ſeventy before, which in all make two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and ten. But it is not worth our while to trouble our ſelves with ſuch uncertainties: much leſs is it ſafe to rely upon any thing which is ſupported by no ſtronger Authority then the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Tradition. The vanity of which appears moſt notoriouſly in this, that <hi>Manaſſeh Ben Iſrael</hi> ſaith <note n="*" place="margin">
                  <hi>Lib. 1.</hi> de Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect. Cap. ult.</note>, it is evidently certain by Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, that the <hi>Mahometans</hi> at this day pay a great reverence to this holy man's Sepulchre, and honour it at <hi>Conſtanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nople</hi> with much religion and devotion: when all men that have any conſiderable ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance with other Authours beſides thoſe
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:106870:157"/>of their own Nation (upon which the <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brews</hi> dote) may eaſily know, that the <hi>Job</hi> whom the <hi>Turks</hi> honour was a Captain of the <hi>Saracens,</hi> who was ſlain when they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieged that City in the year of <hi>Chriſt</hi> 675.</p>
            <p>It will be to better purpoſe, if I take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of an obſervation of theirs which hath more certainty in it; becauſe clearly founded upon the Holy Scriptures. Which is, that <hi>Job</hi> was a <hi>Prophet among the Gentiles;</hi> and a Prophet of very eminent quality and degree. Who deſerved to have been at leaſt mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by <hi>Joſephus</hi> in his Book of <hi>Antiquities,</hi> where he hath not vouchſafed to Name him: nay, to have been praiſed by the Son of <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rach</hi> in his Catalogue of famous men, (XLIV. <hi>Ecclus, &amp;c.</hi>) who were honoured in their Generations, and were the glory of their Times. But, according to the humour of the <hi>Jews,</hi> he magnifies onely thoſe of their own Country, or ſuch from whom they were directly deſcended: not conſidering how much it was for their honour, that by the care of their noble Anceſtours the Hiſtory of <hi>Job</hi> and his excellent Vertues had been pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved. Which he ought not therefore to have omitted; but to have celebrated him among the chief of thoſe Worthy perſons, <hi>by whom God wrought great glory; ſuch as did bear rule in their Kingdoms, men renowned for their power, giving counſel by their underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, and declaring prophecies,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>XLIV.</hi> Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clus 2, 3.</p>
            <pb n="288" facs="tcp:106870:158"/>
            <p>Nay, his Friends deſerved a ſhort remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance, who ſeem nothing inferiour to the Wiſe men among the <hi>Jews,</hi> (though they miſtook in the application of many excellent Truths,) but are acknowledged by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to have been Prophets among the Gentiles. And not without reaſon; for <hi>Eliphaz</hi> we reade IV. 13, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> had Night<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions, an Apparition of an Angel, and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret Whiſpers, like the ſtill ſmall Voice which <hi>Elijah</hi> heard 1 <hi>Kings</hi> XIX. 12. which made <hi>R. Sol. Jarchi</hi> not fear to ſay that the <hi>Shechi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nah</hi> was upon him. And <hi>Elihu,</hi> it is eaſy to diſcern, felt a Divine Power working in him mightily, XXXII. 8, 18, 19. which was not altogether a ſtranger he ſhews (XXXIII. 15, 16.) to other men; whom God in thoſe days inſtructed by Dreams, among other ways that he had of communicating his mind to them. But there was none equal to that wherein He made Himſelf known to <hi>Job:</hi> who in <hi>three</hi> things ſeems to have had the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eminence above all the Gentile Prophets. <hi>Firſt,</hi> In that God was pleaſed to ſpeak to him aloud by a Voice from Heaven, XXXVIII. 1. (which the <hi>Jews</hi> call the <hi>Bath Col,</hi>) and not merely in ſuch ſilent Whiſpers as He did to <hi>Eliphaz. Secondly,</hi> That this Voice was attended with a notable token of a Divine Preſence, from whence it came, <hi>viz.</hi> a <hi>Whirlwind:</hi> which I take to have been ſomething like that <hi>ſound as of a ruſhing
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:106870:158"/>mighty wind,</hi> wherein the Holy Ghoſt came up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the day of Pentecoſt. And <hi>Laſtly,</hi> He ſaw likewiſe in all probability the appearance of ſome Viſible Majeſty (XLII. 5.) ſuppoſe in a glorious Cloud (as the LXX ſeem to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand it, XXXVIII. 1.) or ſomething like that which <hi>Moſes</hi> beheld in the Buſh, when God firſt called unto him out of the midſt of it. III. <hi>Ex.</hi> 4.</p>
            <p>Which need not at all puzzle our belief; when we conſider that the Church in thoſe days was Catholique, and not as yet confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to any one Family or Nation. God was pleaſed indeed to ſhew an extraordinary grace to <hi>Abraham,</hi> in calling him out of his own Country and Father's Houſe, where Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry had taken a deep root, and had been long growing without any hope of amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. (For if we may give any credit to <hi>Keſſaeus</hi> a Mahometan writer, or to <hi>Elmaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi> a Chriſtian, they were infected with it in the days of <hi>Heber,</hi> who ſtoutly oppoſed it; but with ſo little effect, that though God ſent a whirlwind which threw down all their Idols and broke them in pieces, that falſe worſhip ſtill prevailed.) But this doth not warrant us to imagine that God utterly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected, and neglected all other people: to whom He revealed Himſelf in a very familiar manner, and gave many demonſtrations of his Divine Preſence among them; till they corrupted their ways by ſuch abominable Idolatries, that they became altogether un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable,
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:106870:159"/>and unfit for the ſociety of that Holy Spirit, which oft times moved them. Even among the <hi>Canaanites</hi> (into whoſe Country God led <hi>Abraham</hi>) we find <hi>Melchi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſedeck</hi> was then a Prieſt of the moſt high God; a greater perſon then that Prophet, and the Miniſter of that Oracle (ſome fancy) which <hi>Rebekah</hi> went to conſult when ſhe felt the Twins ſtruggling in her Womb, XXV. <hi>Gen.</hi> 22. To whom I might adde ſeveral others, if I had a mind to prolong this diſcourſe.</p>
            <p>And though the Book before mentioned (<hi>Sedar Olam Rabba,</hi> Chap. 21.) is pleaſed to ſay, that the Holy Ghoſt ceaſed to inſpire men of any other Nation after the giving of the Law; yet it is eaſy to ſhew that therein it contradicts even their own affirmation elſewhere, which is grounded on good reaſon, that <hi>Balaam</hi> was a Prophet divinely moved among the <hi>Syrians</hi> in <hi>Meſopotamia.</hi> He was a man indeed of naughty affections, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined to Superſtition, but ſtill had many il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luminations and motions from the moſt High; as appears not onely by his predictions, but by the expreſs words of <hi>Moſes,</hi> who ſays <hi>the Spirit of God came upon him, XXIV.</hi> Num. 2. To which if I ſhould adde his own teſtimony concerning himſelf, that he <hi>heard the words of God,</hi> and <hi>ſaw the viſion of the Almighty,</hi> and that in an extraordinary manner, <hi>having his eyes open</hi> in his ecſtaſy; I ſee no reaſon why it ſhould be rejected; eſpecially ſince

            <p>All which I have ſaid to ſhew that God did not quite deſert the Gentile World, as long as there were any conſiderable reliques of the ancient Religion remaining among them; and they did not wholly divert to fables, and deliver up themſelves to the guidance of evil ſpirits, againſt the apparent teſtimony of the Holy Spirit of God.

            <p>But the chiefeſt part of the Wiſedom of this Prophet conſiſted in his piety: of which he proved a rare example, as I have ſaid al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready; eſpecially in adverſity.

Or rather he names him alone as an example of a happy man; who endured more then any that we reade of in ancient times, and in the end found the Lord ſo mercifully graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and bountifull to him, that it may in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage all pious men to indure with ſuch wonderfull ſubmiſſion as he did.</p>
            <p>Who when he loſt his goods, his houſe, his children, his health; nay, was all over ulcerous and in great pain; and moreover, was ſolicited by his wife to ſpeak irreverent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; if not irreligiouſly of God, and to deny his Providence; and by his Friends was up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braided as an hypocrite, nay accuſed, in their
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:106870:161"/>paſſion, as a tyrannical Oppreſſour; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they indeavoured to bereave him (as S. <hi>Ambroſe</hi> obſerves <note n="*" place="margin">Lib. 1. <hi>de Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell.

            <p>Thus S. <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> I find moſt elegantly repreſents him as a far more glorious ſpectacle when he ſate on the Dunghill, then the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt Prince, without his vertue, is when he ſits upon a Throne. <q>His Ulcers, ſays he <note n="*" place="margin">Hom.

                  </note> were far more valua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in my account, then all their precious Stones. For what profit do we receive by them? what neceſſity, what want do they ſupply? But theſe Ulcers of his, are the comfort of all manner of heavineſs that can ſeiſe upon us. You may know this to be true, if when a man hath loſt his genuine and onely Son, you ſhew him a thouſand Jewels and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Stones; which give no comfort at all to his grief, nor in the leaſt aſſwage his trouble and pain. But in this caſe, if you remember him of the wounds of <hi>Job,</hi> he preſently finds ſome eaſe; when you ask him, ſaying, why doſt thou weep and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, O Man, on this faſhion? thou haſt loſt one Son; but that Bleſſed Man loſt all the Children he had; and, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with that blow, received a ſtroke in his Fleſh, and ſate naked in the Dung, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſmeared all over with the ſilth that ran out of his Wounds; in a deep Conſumption,
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:106870:162"/>which by little and little waſted that juſt that true, that devout Man: who abſtai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned from all manner of evil, and had God himſelf for the Witneſs of his Vertue. If thou doſt but ſpeak theſe words, inſtantly thou extinguiſheſt the heavineſs of the Mourner, and riddeſt him of all his grief; and ſo the Ulcers of that righteous Man be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come more profitable to him then Jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>Do you therefore conceive now that you have that Champion before your eyes; and that you ſee the Dung, and him ſitting in it; a Statue of Gold, of Diamonds, I am not able to ſay of what: For there is nothing ſo precious as to be worthy to be compared with that Ulcerated Body, whoſe Sores ſhine more brightly then the beams of the Sun; which inlighten onely the eyes of the mind. They make us ſee; and they made the Devil quite blind: for after he had given thoſe wounds in his body, he fled and appeared no more. See here, Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved, how great the gain of affliction is! For when that righteous man was rich and enjoyed his eaſe, the Devil had ſomething to ſay againſt him: though falſely indeed, yet this he had to ſay, <hi>Doth Job ſerve God for nought?</hi> But after he had ſtript him naked, and made him a beggar, he had not a word to ſay; he durſt not ſo much as
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:106870:163"/>open his mouth againſt him. When he was rich, then he adventured to wraſtle with him, and threatned to ſupplant him: but after he had made him poor, deprived him of all he had, and reduced him to the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treameſt grief and ſorrow, he ran away and durſt not renew the aſſault. When his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy was ſound, then he laid violent hands on him: but when he had filled it with wounds, he was routed and fled away van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſhed. By this thou ſeeſt how much Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty may prove better then Riches, Weakneſs then Health, Temptation then Eaſe and Quiet, to thoſe that are vigilant and watchfull: who make a profit of all theſe; and by fighting grow more illuſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and courageous. Who ever ſaw, who ever heard ſuch noble Combats?</q>
            </p>
            <p>But there is none, that I have met withall, who repreſents him in ſuch lively colours, as the ſtreat S. <hi>Baſil;</hi> who in a Sermon of his <note n="*" place="margin">

<pb n="299" facs="tcp:106870:163"/>ſhake off the miſty cloud of ſorrow, and to ſtrengthen their Souls with ſuch gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous and manly thoughts, as might turn this Accident into an occaſion of Crowns. For which end he adviſes them to put themſelves in mind of the Conſtancy of <hi>Job;</hi> and to ſay to themſelves as he did, <hi>The Lord gave, and the Lord hath taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way; as it ſeemed good to the Lord, ſo it is come to paſs.</hi> And by no means, ſays he, let any of you be moved with what hath hapned, either to ſay or think, there is no Providence which rules our affairs; or preſume to accuſe the diſpenſation and judgment of the Lord: but let him fix his eyes on that Champion, and make him his Counſellour, who will adviſe him to bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter thoughts.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>Let him recount in order all the Agonies he endured, and then obſerve how bravely he came off; and how the Devil threw all his darts at him in vain: not one of them giving him a deadly wound. Firſt he ſet upon his Goods, and endeavoured to overwhelm him with the dolefull news of various Calamities, which came tum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling like the waves of the Sea, one upon the neck of another. But all to no pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe; for the Juſt man received them as a Rock doth the fury of a Tempeſt: tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the rage of the Waves into froth, and ſtanding it ſelf immovable. He ſaid not a
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:106870:164"/>word, that we read of, he made no com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints of theſe diſaſters:</q> or if he ſaid any thing we may well preſume it was thoſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent and becoming words which we reade in the concluſion, <q>
                  <hi>The Lord gave, and the Lord hath taken away; as it pleaſed the Lord, ſo it is come to paſs.</hi> But he did not think any of thoſe Calamities that befell him, to be worth his lamenting with his tears.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>Well, but there comes one afterward that tells him a moſt diſmal ſtory, of the death of all his Children by the fall of the houſe wherein they were making merry. At this, it is true, he rent his garments; and it is the firſt expreſſion of his grief that we meet withall, in compliance with the paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of Nature, and to declare himſelf a moſt tender Father. But he ſet ſome bounds to his grief, and adorned what had hapned with thoſe pious words; <hi>The Lord gave, and the Lord hath taken away,</hi> &amp;c. As if he ſhould have ſaid, I was called their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, as long as He, that made me ſo, pleaſed. But now He hath taken off this Crown of Children from my head, and it is not fit for me to contend and diſpute with him about his own. Let that be, which ſeemeth beſt to the Lord. He it was that formed them, I was but the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument. Why ſhould I who am but a Servant, fooliſhly complain of my Maſter; and repine at that decree, which I cannot alter?</q>
            </p>

            <p>
               <q>With ſuch words as theſe that righteous Man wounded the Devil; and, as one would ſay, ſhot a dart quite through his heart. Which ſo inraged him, that ſeeing him ſtill a Conquerour, he made an aſſault upon his Body; which he turned into cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption, and made it become ſuch a bag of worms, that from a Throne it was caſt upon a Dunghill. And yet the good man remained immovable; and when his Body was torn, preſerved ſtill the hidden treaſure of piety in his Soul, of which the Devil could not rob him. And therefore, not knowing what to doe more, he betook himſelf to his old ſtratagem; and inſtiga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting his Wife to entertain irreligious and blaſphemous thoughts, attempted that way to overthrow this Champion. For ſhe, tired with the long continuance of his Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamities, came to him, and clapping her hands at what ſhe beheld, upbraided him with theſe lamentable fruits of his piety: and rehearſing his former proſperity, and then pointing at his preſent which he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived from the Lord for all his Sacrifices. With abundance of ſuch like words, which were enough to diſturb the moſt compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, and ſubvert the moſt ſteady and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved mind. I am a vagabond, ſaid ſhe, and am forced to crouch to others like a ſlave. I, who was a Queen, am conſtrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:106870:165"/>to depend upon my ſervants for relief: I, who maintained many liberally, am now nouriſhed my ſelf out of other folks cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity. Adding, that it would be far better for him, to provoke his angry Creatour, by impious words, to cut him off; then by an unprofitable patience thus to prolong both his and her miſery.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>But he, more offended with theſe words then any of his former ſufferings, with eyes full of indignation look'd upon her as an enemy; and ask'd what ailed her to talk thus like one of the fooliſh women? Lay aſide, ſaid he, theſe thoughts, and let me hear no more of this advice; which makes me appear to my ſelf, as if one half of me were wicked and irreligious. <hi>What, ſhall we receive good at the hands of the Lord, and ſhall we not ſuffer evil?</hi> Remember all the paſt happineſ thou haſt enjoyed; and oppoſe better unto worſe. No man's life is intirely and throughout happy. <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. To be always as well as we can wiſh, belongs to God. If thou art grieved at what is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, fetch thy comfort from what thou haſt received before. Now thou weepeſt, but formerly thou didſt laugh; now thou art poor, but there was a time when thou wantedſt nothing. Then thou drankeſt of the pure fountain of life; be content, and drink now the more patiently of the
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:106870:165"/>troubled waters. Behold the Rivers, their ſtreams are not clear in all places. And our life thou knoweſt is like to one of them, which ſlides away continually, and is oft times full of waves, which come rol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing one upon another. One part of this River is paſſed by; and another is running on its courſe. This part of it is guſhing out from the fountain; and the next is ready to follow it, as ſoon as it is gone. And thus we are all making great haſt to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Sea; death I mean, which ſwallows up all at laſt.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>If we receive good from the hands of the Lord, ſhall we not bear evil? Think of that again. Shall we go about to compell the Judge, to afford us juſt the very ſame things for ever? Shall we preſume to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct our Lord and Maſter how he ought to conduct our life? He hath the power of His own decrees and orders; as He pleaſes, ſo he appoints our portion for us. And we know that He is wiſe; and that He diſpenſes to His ſervants what is moſt profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table for them. Do not then curiouſly pry into the counſels and reſolution of thy Lord and Governour: onely take in good part, and affectionately embrace, whatſoever is ordered by his Wiſedom. Love his Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtration; and whatſoever He is pleaſed to give, receive it with pleaſure. Demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate now in a ſorrowfull condition, that

            <p>
               <q>Thus <hi>Job</hi> diſcourſing, he baffled the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil once more; and gave him ſuch a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſe, that he made him perfectly aſhamed to ſee himſelf thus vanquiſhed. And what enſued after this? why, when the Devil was beaten, his diſeaſe fled away too; ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving aſſaulted him in vain, and got no ground of him. His fleſh began to recover into a ſecond Youth. He flouriſhed alſo in his Eſtate, which was reſtored to him with increaſe. For Riches flowed ſo plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifully into his houſe, that they were dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to what he had before. Firſt, that he might be no loſer by his Affliction; and Secondly, that he might have a mercifull reward of his patience under it. Therefore it was that his Horſes, and Mules, and Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mels, and Sheep, and all the reſt of his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venue were doubled: onely his Children were no more then equal to the number he had before; ſeven Sons, and three Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters. The reaſon was, becauſe his Beaſts indeed intirely periſhed; but the better part of his Children ſtill ſurvived, when they were taken from him. And therefore being again adorned with as many Sons and Daughters, as formerly he enjoyed, he had a double portion of them alſo: thoſe who were preſent with him here, and thoſe who expected him in the other World. Behold
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:106870:166"/>then, what good things this juſt man, <hi>Job,</hi> heaped up to himſelf by his patient ſubmiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to God. And do thou therefore, if thou haſt ſuffered grievouſly in this ſire, which the malice of the Devil kindled, bear it conſtantly; and lenify the affliction with theſe better thoughts: according to that which is written, <hi>Caſt all thy care upon the Lord, and he will ſuſtain thee.</hi>

And there is great reaſon to think that he did not, in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs of it, ſwerve from thoſe good begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings, which had ſo bleſſed a concluſion: but whatſoever expreſſions fell from him, when he was engaged in the heat of Diſpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, he ſtill preſerved ſuch a religious tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per of mind, as made him not ceaſe to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit himſelf reverently to God's will, and to thank him for all the benefits he had former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly received from his Bounty.

            <p>To which opinion of <hi>Job,</hi> ſay they, every one of his Friends oppoſed a particular opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of their own, differing each of them from the other. And firſt <hi>Eliphaz</hi> endeavours to eſtabliſh this for a certain truth; <q>That as Afflictions do not come by chance but by the Providence of God, ſo they are ſent for the ſins of men; and therefore without all
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:106870:167"/>doubt <hi>Job</hi> was a great offendour, which was the cauſe he was handled on this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner. This opinion, ſays <hi>Maimonides,</hi> he held to the laſt; onely was fain to adde in concluſion, that all the ways whereby we deſerve puniſhment do not appear.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Then after him (when <hi>Job</hi> had argued againſt this) comes <hi>Bildad,</hi> who produces a new opinion, grounded upon the doctrine of permutation, or recompence, as they ſpeak. <q>That is, he believed the Evils which <hi>Job</hi> indured here, ſhould, if he proved inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent, be changed into good things; and in the iſſue be highly ſerviceable to him in another world.</q>
            </p>
            <p>After whom ſucceeds <hi>Zophar</hi> with a different reſolution from all theſe; which was, that <q>God acts according to his own pleaſure, and that we are not to ſearch for any cauſe of his actions out of his own will; nor to ſay, why doth he this and not that? In ſhort, we are not to ſeek the way of equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and the decree of wiſedom in his do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings; for it neceſſarily belongs to his Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence that He doe what He will: and our underſtanding is too ſhallow to compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend the ſecrets of his Wiſedom, whoſe right and propriety it is that He may do according to his Pleaſure, and for no other cauſe.</q>
            </p>
            <p>And theſe <hi>four</hi> Opinions about Providence <hi>Maimonides</hi> undertakes to ſhew have had
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:106870:168"/>their ſeveral Aſſertors ſince; who have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagated them among their Scholars. <hi>Job</hi>'s opinion he ſaith is the ſame with <hi>Ariſtotle</hi>'s, who attributed all to accident. <hi>Bildad</hi> was followed by the Sect of <hi>Mutazali</hi> (a kind of <hi>Phariſees</hi> among the <hi>Iſmaelites</hi>) who aſcribed all to Wiſedom: <hi>Zophar</hi> by the Sect of <hi>Aſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria,</hi> who attributed all to will and pleaſure: And <hi>Eliphaz,</hi> he fancies, held the opinion of the Law; which is, that God deals with men according to their works.</p>
            <p>But when all that theſe men had diſputed, nothing moved <hi>Job,</hi> there ſtands up another, whoſe name was <hi>Elihu,</hi>
               <q>who firſt proves the Providence of God from prophetical dreams, XXXIII. 13. and to thoſe things which <hi>Eliphaz</hi> had ſaid, adds, according to the imagination of <hi>Menaſſeh Ben-Iſrael,</hi> the doctrine of the tranſmigration of Souls (which he labours to find in v. 14.) and thereby in a wonderfull way, ſays he, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolves all the doubt; by determining that <hi>Job</hi> and other juſt men, may be puniſhed for ſins which they committed in a former body.</q>
            </p>
            <p>But as there is no footſtep that I can ſee for this fond conceit, which he honours with the name of a myſtery; ſo it is evident theſe men follow their own vain inventions in all this diſcourſe, directly contrary to the Book it ſelf. For they make <hi>Job</hi>'s opinion the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry worſt of all the reſt; when the Lord him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:106870:168"/>tells <hi>Eliphaz</hi> in the concluſion of the Book (XLII. 7.) that He was angry with him and his two other Friends; becauſe they had not ſpoken of him ſo rightly as <hi>Job</hi> had. And it doth not appear by their ſpeeches that they held ſeveral opinions about Providence, and took every one of them a different way (that's a meer Rabbinical ſubtilty) to ſolve the doubt, wherein <hi>Job</hi>'s unuſual ſufferings had perplexed them. But they ſeem to have harped all of them upon one and the ſame ſtring; as I have repreſented in the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments before each Chapter: which it is thought fit ſhould be here ſet down by themſelves; that the Reader may take a view of the whole work all together.</p>
            <p>From whence the concluſion of <hi>Maimoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des</hi> will be very evident (which is the beſt thing he ſays) that <hi>The ſcope of the Book is, to eſtabliſh the great Article of Providence; and thereby to preſerve us from errour, in think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that God's Knowledge is like our Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge; or his Intention, Providence, and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, like our Intention, Providence, and Government. Which foundation being laid, nothing will ſeem hard to a man, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever happens. Nor will he fall into dubious thoughts concerning God; whether He knows what is befaln us or no; and whether He takes any care of us. But rather he will be inflamed the more vehemently in the love of God; as it is
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:106870:169"/>ſaid in the end of this Prophecy; Wherefore I abhor my ſelf and repent in duſt and aſhes. So ſay our Wiſe men;</hi> They that act out of love, will rejoyce in Chaſtiſements.</p>

            <p>
               <label>CHAP. I. ARGUMENT.</label> THIS Chapter is a plain Narration of the flouriſhing condition wherein <hi>Job</hi> lived, before the envy and malice of the Devil brought upon him the ſoreſt Calamities; which are particularly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed, with the occaſion of them, and his admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Conſtancy under them: whereby he became as emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent an example of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience in Adverſity, as he had been of Piety and all manner of Vertue in his Proſperity. <hi>fol. 1</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <label>CHAP. II. ARGUMENT.</label> The firſt part of this Chapter is a continuation of the Narration, which was begun in the foregoing, of the Calamities which befell this good man; whom God ſuffered the Devil to afflict in his Body, as he had already done in his
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:106870:170"/>Goods and Children. And then follows a farther te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony of his Conſtancy, notwithſtanding his Wife's angry and profane accuſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Divine Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence. Though, it is true, he was ſo much de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected to ſee himſelf redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to this extremity of Miſery, that neither he, nor his Friends that came to viſit him, were able for ſeveral days to ſpeak a word. <hi>fol. 11</hi>

            <p>
               <label>CHAP. III. ARGUMENT.</label> Here begin the Diſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes which <hi>Job</hi> and his Friends had about his Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction; which are all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented, by the Authour of this Book, poetically; not, as hitherto, in a plain ſimple Narration, but in moſt elegant verſe. And being overcharged with Grief, (without the leaſt word of comfort from his Friends,) he that had for ſome time born the weight of his Aſſlictions with an admirable Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy, could not contain himſelf any longer, but burſts out (to ſuch a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree was the anguiſh of his ſpirit increaſed) into the moſt paſſionate Camplaints of the Miſeries of humane Life. The conſideration of which made him prefer Death much before it; and wiſh that, either he had never come into the world, or gone preſently out of it again, or, at leaſt, might now forthwith he diſmiſſed. <hi>fol. 17</hi>

               <hi>Eliphaz</hi> incenſed at this Complaint of <hi>Job,</hi> in ſtead of condoling with him, and pitying the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeries which had put him into this Agony, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying fitting Lenitives to his Anguiſh; bluntly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bukes him for not follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the good Advice that he uſed to give to others in their Adverſity: and tells him, he had reaſon to
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:106870:170"/>ſuſpect his Piety, becauſe the Innocent were not wont to ſuffer ſuch things, but onely wicked Oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſours; whom, though ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſo mighty, God had always humbled. Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs the <hi>Horims,</hi> who dwelt in <hi>Seir,</hi> (II. <hi>Deut. 12.</hi>) whom the anceſtours of <hi>Eliphaz</hi> (XXXVI. <hi>Gen. 11.</hi>) had overcome, though they were as fierce as Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. To thoſe Beaſts of prey, of all ſorts, he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pares the Tyrants whom he ſpeaks of in this Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, v. <hi>10, 11.</hi> intending, it is likely, to remember him alſo of the deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the <hi>Emims</hi> by the children of <hi>Moab,</hi> (II. <hi>Deut. 10, 11.</hi>) and of the <hi>Zamzummims,</hi> (v. <hi>20, 21.</hi>) who were rooted out by the children of <hi>Ammon,</hi> as the <hi>Horims</hi> by the children of <hi>Eſau:</hi> from whoſe Grandchild <hi>Eliphaz</hi> ſeems to have been deſcended, and cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by the name of the eldeſt Son of <hi>Eſau.</hi> He tells <hi>Job</hi> alſo of a Viſion he had, to confirm the ſame truth, That man's Wickedneſs is the cauſe of his Deſtruction. <hi>fol. 22, 23</hi>

               <label>CHAP. V. ARGUMENT.</label>
               <hi>Eliphaz</hi> ſtill proſecutes the very ſame Argument; endeavouring to confirm it from the opinion and obſervation of other men, as well as from his own. And thereupon exhorts him to Repentance, as the ſureſt way to find mercy with God; and to be not onely reſtored to his former Proſperity, but to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved hereafter from the Incurſions of ſavage peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, or of wild beaſts, and from all the reſt of the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſters which had befaln him.

<pb n="314" facs="tcp:106870:171"/>by theſe Diſcourſes, juſtifies the Complaint he had made, (Chap. III.) which <hi>Eliphaz</hi> had now accuſed; maintaining that his Grief was not equal to the Cauſe of it. And therefore he renews his wiſhes of Death: at which though they might wonder who felt nothing to make them weary of Life; yet he had reaſon, he ſhews, for what he did; and one more then before, which was their <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nkindneſs: who pretended to be Friends; but by this rude Reproof of him at the very firſt, without ſo much as one compaſſionate word, or the leaſt ſyllable of Conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, ſhewed how little ſympathy they had with him in his Sufferings. Theſe things he deſires them to conſider, and weigh the cauſe of his Complaint a little better, before they paſſed any farther judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment on it. <hi>fol. 33</hi>

               <label>CHAP. VII. ARGUMENT.</label>
               <hi>Job</hi> proceeds ſtill in the defence of his Complaint, and of his Wiſhes to ſee an end of ſo miſerable a Life; which at the beſt is full of Toil and Trouble. And, ſince his Friends had ſo little conſideration of him, he addreſſes himſelf to God; and hopes he will not be angry if he eaſe his Grief by repreſenting to him the Dolefulneſs of his condition, and expoſtula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting a little with him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the continuance of it, and his releaſe from it. <hi>fol. 39</hi>

            <p>
               <label>CHAP. VIII. ARGUMENT.</label> The foregoing Apologies of <hi>Job,</hi> it ſeems, made little impreſſion on his Friends: for, he had no ſooner done, but another of them, called <hi>Bildad,</hi> continued the Diſpute;
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:106870:171"/>with as little intermiſſion, as there was between the Meſſengers that brought him (Chap. I.) the ſad tidings of his Calamities. And it doth not appear by his diſcourſe, that he dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered at all in his Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples from <hi>Eliphaz.</hi> For, though he give him very good Counſel, yet, he ſtill preſſes this as the ſenſe of all Antiquity, (v. <hi>8.</hi>) that God ever proſpers the Juſt, and roots out the Wicked, be they never ſo flouriſhing for a ſeaſon. And he being deſcended from <hi>Shuah,</hi> one of <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi>'s Sons by <hi>Keturah,</hi> (XXV. <hi>Gen. 2.</hi>) ſeems to me to have a particular re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect, in this appeal to Hiſtory, unto the Records, which then remained, of God's bleſſing upon that faithfull man's poſterity, (who hitherto, and long after, continued in his Religion,) and of the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirpation of thoſe Eaſtern people, (neighbours to <hi>Job,</hi>) in whoſe countrey they were ſettled, becauſe of their Wickedneſs. <hi>fol. 44</hi>

            <p>
               <label>CHAP. IX. ARGUMENT.</label>
               <hi>Job</hi> allows what <hi>Bildad</hi> had well ſpoken in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of his Speech; and very religiouſly adores the Juſtice, Wiſedom, and Sovereignty of the Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty: with whom he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſts he had no intention to quarrel or diſpute; but onely to aſſert the contrary Maxime to that which they maintained, That Piety will not ſecure us from all Calamities, which do not ever fall upon thoſe that deſerve them. Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, on one hand, the proſperous eſtate of wicked Princes, v. <hi>24.</hi> (particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly of one great Prince, who then ſomewhere reigned in their neighbou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring countries;) and, on the other hand, his own Infelicity, notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his known Integrity, v. <hi>25.</hi> About this he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſes he was very much unſatisfied: though he knew it was in vain to argue with God about it;
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:106870:172"/>nor would his Affliction ſuffer him to doe it. <hi>fol. 49, 50</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <label>CHAP. X. ARGUMENT.</label> In this Chapter the paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionate Complaints and Expoſtulations with God, from which <hi>Job</hi> tells us (in the foregoing Chapter) he intended hereafter to refrain, break out afreſh; and he earneſtly deſires to know what his Guilt is: which God, who made him, he was ſure could not but perfectly under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, if there was any; and needed not, for the diſcovery of it, to expoſe him to theſe ſevere Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. Which, he ſtill is of the opinion, may juſtify his Wiſhes of never being born, or of dying preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly after. Though, thoſe Wiſhes being vain, he ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledges it is more rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal to deſire, that God would be pleaſed to inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit his Pain a while; if He did not think fit quite to remove it. <hi>fol. 56</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <label>CHAP. XI.</label> This Chapter gives an account of the ſenſe of <hi>Zo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phar</hi> about the buiſineſs in diſpute. It is uncertain whence he was deſcended; but probably he dwelt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the borders of <hi>Idumaea,</hi> (for there we find an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient City called <hi>Naama,</hi> XV. <hi>Joſh. 41.</hi>) and from thence came to viſit <hi>Job</hi> in his Affliction. But in ſtead of joyning with him in his Prayer for a little reſpite from his Pain, (with which <hi>Job</hi> had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded his laſt Diſcourſe,) he calls him an idle Talker, and accuſes him of irreve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence towards God. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning whoſe incompre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſible Counſels, and ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſiſtible Power, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> he diſcourſes with great ſenſe, and gives <hi>Job</hi> exceeding good Advice: but ſtill fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows the opinion of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther two Friends, that he would not have been ſo miſerable, if he had not been Wicked. <hi>fol. 61</hi>

               <label>CHAP. XII.

And lets them underſtand, that he need not come to them to learn, but might rather teach them the falſeneſs of that Propoſition, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with <hi>Zophar</hi> had conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded his Speech, concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Infelicity of the Wicked.

               <label>CHAP. XVII. ARGUMENT.</label> Here <hi>Job</hi> deſires he may be tried preſently before God's Tribunal, his Life being juſt upon the point to expire, as he had ſaid in the end of the former
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:106870:174"/>Chapter; and continues to urge again in this, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe his Friends were ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry unfit Judges in his caſe, and had paſſed ſuch a Sentence upon him, as upright men would never approve of. Whereby they had given him a new Vex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, to hear them talk ſo idly, and put him in hope of recovering his Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs, if he would follow their Admonitions; when they ſaw him juſt dropping into the Grave, which was the onely thing, he ſaith, that he could hope for. <hi>fol. 97</hi>

               <label>CHAP. XVIII. ARGUMENT.</label> In this Chapter <hi>Bildad</hi> again takes up the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute, and pretends to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply to what <hi>Job</hi> had ſaid. But I do not ſee any thing new, ſaving the deſcripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on he makes (as <hi>Eliphaz</hi> had done before him) of the Ruine which ſhall ine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitably fall, according to the fixed rules of Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, (ſo he fancied) upon the Wicked and his family; notwithſtanding all the aſſiſtence that his Friends and Allies can lend him for his Preſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. And this he ſeems to imply was the fate of <hi>Job;</hi> whom he doth not ſo much as exhort to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, (as he had done in his former Diſcourſe Chap. VIII.) being very angry with him, that he had no higher eſteem of their Wiſedom. <hi>fol. 101</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <label>CHAP. XIX. ARGUMENT.</label> The purpoſe of this Chapter (in which <hi>Job</hi> replies to <hi>Bildad</hi>) is to ſhew, that it would be ſufficient for him alſo merely to repeat the ſame things, as they had done in Ten Diſcourſes: But the more to aggravate their want of Compaſſion, or rather Cruelty, toward him, he repreſents ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral new things, which made his condition more deplorable then he had hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto ſaid. One of which
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:106870:174"/>was, that he could not tell the Reaſon why God dealt thus with him: who notwithſtanding was ſo gracious, that in the depth of this Miſery and An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh, He affords Him a glimring of a comfortable Hope, (which began now to appear in his Soul, and which he had hitherto wanted,) that God would at laſt take pity upon him, and ſhew his Friends their errour, by reſtoring him to his former Health and Splendour. That ſeems to be the literal meaning of the <hi>25.</hi> and <hi>26.</hi> verſes, and of the two next that follow: where, among o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther things, he ſays he doubted not but his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer ſhould <hi>ſtand laſt upon the earth,</hi> (ſo it is in the Hebrew, the word <hi>day</hi> not being there,) that is, quite overcome the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil, and deliver him from theſe Diſtreſſes; like a mighty Conquerour, who keeps the field, when all his oppoſers are routed and fled away. But in this he was, as S. <hi>Auſtin</hi> calls him, <hi>eximius Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetarum,</hi> and propheſied of the Reſurrection of the Body at the laſt day. <hi>fol. 106, 107</hi>

            <p>
               <label>CHAP. XX. ARGUMENT.</label> The abrupt beginning of this Speech of <hi>Zophar</hi> ſhews that he was in a paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion; which, though he pretends to bridle it, would not let him calmly conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Proteſtation which <hi>Job</hi> had made of his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocence. But he goes on in the old Common place of the certain Downfall of the Wicked, be he never ſo powerfull and well ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported. Which he illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates indeed after an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent faſhion, with great variety of Figures, and remarks upon Hiſtories as old as the World. In ſome of which he had obſerved, that the Wicked after their Fall had made notable at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts to get up again; but by the hand of God were ſo cruſhed, that they could never riſe more. All the flaw in his Diſcourſe is this,
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:106870:175"/>(which was common to him with the reſt,) that he imagined God never va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried from this method; and therefore <hi>Job,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out doubt, was a very bad man, though it did not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear he was, any other way, but by his Infelicity. <hi>fol. 114, 115</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <label>CHAP. XXI. ARGUMENT.</label> To bring the Diſpute to a ſpeedier iſſue, <hi>Job</hi> (af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a ſhort preface, repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving their Incivility) comes cloſe to the buiſineſs: and doth not content him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf merely with denying what they had ſaid, but ſhews them where the fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lacy in their Diſcourſe lay; <hi>viz.</hi> in concluding an <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niverſal from ſome Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars. For he main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, from as good Hiſtory and Obſervations as they could produce, that, though God do make ſome Wicked men ſuch examples of his Vengeance, as they had ſaid, yet He lets others, and they of the vileſt ſort, Atheiſts and Deriders of Divine Providence, live proſperouſly, and die peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably, and have ſtately Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numents built to perpetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate their Memory. In brief, he ſhews there is great variety in God's pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings about the Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Wicked; which makes them ſo bold as they are in their Impie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. And ſeems to have reſpect to the Hiſtory of <hi>Iſhmael,</hi> who was a <hi>wild,</hi> or barbarous, <hi>man,</hi> graſp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at all he could lay his hands on, and perſecuting <hi>Iſaac;</hi> and yet had XII Princes deſcended from him, ſettled in their ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Fortreſſes, as we reade XVI. <hi>Gen. 12.</hi> XVII. <hi>20.</hi> XXV. <hi>16.</hi> And it is poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, to the Hiſtory of <hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaz</hi> his own Country: <hi>Eſau</hi> his Anceſtour being very rich, (XXXVI. <hi>Gen. 6, 7.</hi>) and having many Dukes, whoſe poſterity af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward advanced them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to the title of Kings, that ſprang from him, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore there was any King o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the Children of <hi>Iſrael.</hi> XXXVI. <hi>Gen. 15, 31. fol. 122, 123</hi>

               <label>CHAP. XXII.

And to avoid the Reproof, which had been given him, of repeating merely the ſame things; he now brings in a catalogue, though without any proof, (ſo much was his anger and bitterneſs increaſed,) of the particular Sins, both againſt God and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt his Neighbour, of which he ſuppoſes <hi>Job</hi> to have been guilty. Elſe, he ſtill boldly concludes, God would not have pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed him with ſuch ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verity, that there was not a greater inſtance of his Indignation to be found any-where; unleſs it was in the Old World, and in <hi>Sodom.</hi> Yet he hath ſo much Moderation, that be invites him at laſt to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, and promiſes him the happy fruit of it; as he had done in his <hi>firſt</hi> Speech, but not in his <hi>ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond.</hi> Nay, he tells him, in concluſion, for his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement, that he ſhould be able to doe as much for a Nation, as <hi>Ten</hi> righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous men, could they have been found there, might have done for <hi>Sodom. fol. 131, 132</hi>

               <label>CHAP. XXV. ARGUMENT.</label> The foregoing Diſcourſe of <hi>Job,</hi> in the XXIV.

               <label>CHAP. XXVII.

For it ſignifies a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> an elegant ingenious kind of ſpeech, excelling, and, as it were, domineering over, all other, in its pithineſs, or neatneſs, or ſome other rare quality. Such is the following Diſcourſe of <hi>Job,</hi> which begins (in this Chapter) with a vehement Proteſtation, that he would never deſert his Plea; nor yield to their Doctrine, that a remarkable Venge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance always attends upon Wickedneſs in this world: though he grants, and largely here aſſerts, that ſometimes there doth. <hi>fol. 158, 159</hi>

Which he diſcovers in the judici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Cenſures he here paſſes, not onely upon the three Friends, but upon <hi>Job</hi> himſelf: whom he hath nothing to charge with all, relating to any Crime com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted before this Affliction befell him; but thinks be had not managed the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute about it with ſo much Calmneſs and Submiſſion to God as became his Pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. In this he differs from thoſe that ſpake before him: For I do not find that he blames him for a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Miſcarriages, but thoſe onely which he obſerved in the heat of his Diſputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and he ſpends his time, rather in juſtifying God, then in carping at <hi>Job,</hi> as the other had done. <hi>fol. 198, 199</hi>

And <hi>then</hi> begins to reprehend thoſe paſſages which he thought were blameable in <hi>Job</hi>'s Speeches; particularly his inſiſting ſo much upon his Integrity: which, though true, ſhould not have been
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:106870:178"/>mentioned without due ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgment, that the Sovereign of the World had done him no wrong in thus afflicting him; and that it was not fit for him to queſtion the Wiſedom and Juſtice of God's Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, becauſe he did not underſtand it. For the care of God over Man and his kindneſs to him, he ſhews, is ſo apparent, upon ſo many ſcores, that it ought not to be denied becauſe of the unaccoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table Afflictions that may befall us; which we ought rather to think are one of the ways whereby He doth Man good. <hi>fol. 205</hi>

And ſo this young man proceeds to carry the Charge a little higher, and tells him, with more ſharpneſs then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, that there were ſome words in his Diſcourſes which ſounded in his ears, as if he accuſed God's Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice and Goodneſs. For what elſe did he mean when he complained that God did not doe him right; and that he deſtroyed alike both good and bad? Which raſh Aſſertions he overthrows from the conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration of the Sovereign Dominion, Power, Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs and Wiſedom of God: and repreſents to him what behaviour and diſcourſe would have bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter become him, then that which he had uſed. <hi>fo. 214</hi>

               <hi>Elihu</hi> continues his Speech, which he had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun before, concerning the incomprehenſible Works of God: and limits himſelf chiefly, as he had in the foregoing Chapter, to the Wonders God doeth in the Clouds. To which, at laſt, he ſubjoyns the ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing extent, brightneſs and firmneſs of the Skie; in which the Sun ſhines with a luſtre, which we are not able to behold. And thence concludes, that the Splendour of the Divine Majeſty is infinite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly more dazling, and that we muſt not pretend to give an account of his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels. <hi>fol. 237</hi>

               <label>CHAP. XXXVIII. ARGUMENT.</label> What <hi>Elihu</hi> had ſaid concerning the Divine Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty, in the <hi>22.</hi> verſe of the foregoing, God de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares to be true, by a ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible demonſtration, as I have expreſſed it in the firſt Verſe of this Chapter. In which God appears himſelf as a Judge (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to <hi>Job</hi>'s repeated deſires) to decide this great Controverſy. And taking up the Argument begun by <hi>Elihu,</hi> (who came neareſt to the truth,) and proſecuting it in uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitable words, (excelling his and all other mens in the loftineſs of the ſtyle, as much as Thunder doth a Whiſper,) He convinces <hi>Job</hi> of his Ignorance and Weakneſs; by ſhewing him how little he under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood of the moſt obvious things in this World. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending from thence, at laſt, to infer, that he who found himſelf puzzled, when he went about to give an account of the meaneſt of God's viſible Works, ſhould not preſume to penetrate into his ſecret Counſels; nor queſtion his Goodneſs, no more then he could his Wiſedom and Power, though he knew not why he was afflicted.
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:106870:180"/>One inſtance had been ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to bring <hi>Job</hi> to a Non-plus; but He heaps up abundance, to humble him the more, when he ſaw how much cauſe there was for it: whether he conſidered the Earth, or the Heavens; the Sea, or the Sun; things con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in the boſom of the Sea, or in the bowels of the Earth; eſpecially all the Meteors (as we call them) which are formed in the Clouds, and the Conſtellations in the higher Regions; together with the Beaſts upon the earth, and the Birds which fly in the air; one of each of which he mentions in the end of this Chapter. <hi>fol. 244, 245</hi>

               <label>CHAP. XXXIX. ARGUMENT.</label> This Chapter continues the Diſcourſe begun in the latter end of the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going, concerning God's Providence about Beaſts and Birds. And to the <hi>Two</hi> before mentioned, he adds <hi>Seven</hi> more. Firſt, the <hi>wild Goat</hi> or <hi>Hinde,</hi> whoſe hard la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour among the rocks God is wont to help and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote (as the Pſalmiſt ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves XXIX. <hi>9.</hi> and other Authours agree) by a clap of Thunder; the terrour of which puts her into ſuch an agony, that ſhe preſently excludes her young one, which ſticks in the birth. Then he mentions the <hi>wild Aſs;</hi> and after that a tall Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture in thoſe Countries called <hi>Reem:</hi> which we render an <hi>Unicorn;</hi> but <hi>Bochartus</hi> hath proved to be a <hi>two-horned Goat</hi> in <hi>Arabia</hi> of great ſtrength, with an erected head and ears. Of the reſt I need ſay nothing here, they are ſo well known. <hi>fol. 254</hi>

               <label>CHAP. XL. ARGUMENT.</label>
               <hi>Job</hi> modeſtly declining to ſay one word in his own defence, (though he was graciouſly invited by God
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:106870:180"/>to ſpeak, if he had any Plea remaining,) is ſtill more humbled by a plain declaration from the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Majeſty, that <hi>Elihu</hi> had reaſon to reprove him for his immoderate Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints, (which ſome might look upon as an Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſation of God's Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence;) and for main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining his own Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs ſo much, and God's Righteouſneſs ſo little, in the Diſpute he had with his Friends. Shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him withall, that he was not ſenſible enough of the infinite Diſtance and Inequality between him and God; when he deſired ſo vehemently to argue his Caſe with Him, that he forgot to make thoſe Submiſſions to the Divine Majeſty, which had better become him. This Diſproportion is moſt lively repreſented and il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſtrated, by an admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble deſcription of the ſtrength of the BEHE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MOTH, a word of <hi>Egyptian</hi> termination; ſignifying, not the <hi>Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phant,</hi> (which ſeldome lies down, and never a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong reeds, as this doth, v. <hi>21.</hi>) but a creature in that Country called by the <hi>Greek</hi> Writers <hi>Hippo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potamus,</hi> i. e. River-horſe. For it appears by the Second book of <hi>Eſdras,</hi> Chap. VI. v. <hi>49.</hi> that the <hi>Hebrews</hi> reckon <hi>Behe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moth,</hi> not among the Land-creatures, but a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong thoſe belonging to the Water, which were created on the <hi>fifth</hi> day. And there is none, that we know, of that ſort, to whom the Characters here mentioned belong, but the Creature now named. <hi>fol. 261, 262</hi>

               <label>CHAP. XLII.

This Repentance God accepts; and for his ſake grants a Pardon alſo to his Friends, whom he condemns as more faulty then <hi>Job.</hi> Who after this receives extraordinary marks of God's Favour; and hath ſuch an ample Recompence made him for his Loſſes, as may incourage all poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity to perſevere in well doing and patient ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring; believing ſtedfaſtly that nothing can be done
